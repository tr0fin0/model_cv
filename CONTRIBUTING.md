## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the [README](./README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/tr0fin0/latex-cv/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tr0fin0/latex-cv/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions.
- To see if other users have experienced, and potentially already solved, the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/tr0fin0/latex-cv/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet to see if users outside of the project have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack Trace
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tr0fin0/latex-cv/issues/new) using the adequate template.
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.
- Please describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for LaTeX CV, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Ensure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [README](./README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered.
- Search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/tr0fin0/latex-cv/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tr0fin0/latex-cv/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most LaTeX CV users.
